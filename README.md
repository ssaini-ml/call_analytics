# Call Analytics (POC)

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks for a data analysis project. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

```

## Setup and Installation

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

### Using pip

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data

- Source: Describe where the data comes from.
- Format: Specify file types (CSV, JSON, etc.).
- Preprocessing: Mention any necessary preprocessing steps.

## Notebooks

Each notebook is structured for a specific analysis step:

1. 01_data_exploration.ipynb - Initial data analysis and visualization
2. 02_data_cleaning.ipynb - Handling missing values, outliers, and transformations
3. 03_feature_engineering.ipynb - Creating new features for modeling
4. 04_modeling.ipynb - Training and evaluating machine learning models
5. 05_results.ipynb - Summarizing and interpreting results

## Usage

To run the notebooks, use the following command:

`jupyter notebook`

Then, open the relevant notebook in your browser.
